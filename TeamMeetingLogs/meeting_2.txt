Meeting on 04/03/24 at 6:45

Asked about our invididual updates:
  - Chess Board is visible, but not interactive yet. 
  - We should make the branches named what they are for. For example, if login is being worked on in the branch, then we should name it login and commit that

What we are planning on doing for the next sprint: 
  - Make the chess board interactive
  - Have our website up and visible 

Advice: 
	- stories should accuretly show who is working on it and what is being doing 
	- things should be moved to the in progress area when they are being worked on
  - if they are for the next sprint, put them in ice box 
	- whatever task you work on, try to commit daily to make sure its working 
	- make sure before the meeting there are commits for that feature so they can be looked at
