Minutes:
    Asked what changes have been made since the last meetings.
    - Basic pages were implemented along with their APIs
    - Database complete
    - Game type and timer put in, but the timer only shows one time and does
      not adjust for which game type was selected(Working on fixing)
    - Chess board is made with pieces, but not implemented into the page.
      Pieces can move, but have not established valid moves and taking pieces

    Asked about test cases.
    - Some are made, but others are still being worked on
    - APIs are being reconfigured to allow for the tests to pass

    Asked about what is being worked on individually in the coming week.
    - Each group member stated what they will be working on, and was confirmed
      to be good by the TA

    Advice:
    - Suggested to add more information to the 'Add user' story, or to change
      it to reflect what is being worked on specifically
    - Reminded the group to update release notes
